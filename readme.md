## Overview

This is a 3D printed replacement plunger designed for the Pampered Chef Mixer and Dispenser. The original plunger is known to fail after just a couple of years of use, and this model aims to provide a durable, cost-effective solution.

## Features

- **Compatibility:** Designed to fit perfectly with the Pampered Chef Mixer and Dispenser.
- **Ease of Use:** Simple installation; no tools required beyond basic assembly.

## Installation

1. **Prepare the Hole:** Drill or ream the top of the existing hole to 5/16" (which is just smaller than an 8mm shaft diameter).
2. **Insert the Rod:** Carefully insert the rod and then thread it into the plastic threads. 
   - **Optionally:** For enhanced durability, you can use a threaded insert if desired.

3. **Clean the Area:** Ensure the mixer is clean and free of any residue where the plunger sits.
4. **Remove Old Plunger:** If any part of the old plunger remains, carefully remove it.
5. **Insert New Plunger:** Place the 3D printed plunger into the dispenser, ensuring it moves freely but snugly.
